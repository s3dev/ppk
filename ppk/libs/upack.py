:App:       upack.py
:Purpose:   This module provides a soft (callable) wrapper around the
            embedded ``lib/upack.d/bin/upack`` program, which is
            responsible for verifying and unpacking the encrypted
            archive into the securted environment.

            Additionally, the :class:`~PPKUnPacker` class contains a
            callable method for refreshing the local pip repository,
            which is designed to be called by the base ``ppk.py``
            program, after the call unpack.
